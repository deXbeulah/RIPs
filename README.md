# RIPs 

Relay Improvement Proposals (RIPs) describe feature requests and bug reports for the [Relay browser extension](https://relaychat.app). The name is modeled on Ethereum Improvement Proposals, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, Python Enhancement Proposals, etc., but contributing is much simpler for now because the extension is not yet open source. In the future we may add more process if necessary. 

## Contributing 

Simply create an issue in this repo describing the feature request or bug. Our team will keep you updated on the progress of your proposal. Thanks for making Relay a better application!

## About Relay

Relay is a browser extension that adds anonymous chat to every domain and subdomain on the Internet. We created Relay to remedy the many failures and abuses of modern social media. Relay doesn't advertise, sell your data, censor you, silo communities, engineer addiction with algorithmically generated feeds, or promote marketing and propaganda.

We strive to decentralize social media across an Internet that's increasingly dominated by a few unscrupulous companies. Relay opens all Internet borders and allows every community to converse across all domains.
